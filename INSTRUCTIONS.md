# Python Bootcamp Instructions

![SIR, YES SIR!](pybootcamp-part1/images/FMJ.jpg)

Welcome to Python bootcamp!

This course contains the Python Bootcamp for 2<sup>nd</sup> year astronomers. The idea behind the bootcamp is to prepare you for the Python programming part of PHY241. Programming is a vital skill for a scientist and you'll use it throughout your course, so we want to make sure everyone is on the same page before we start.

## What should I do?

All students **need** to have worked on the bootcamps (parts I and II) over the summer break. Bootcamp part 1 should be revision - it tells you how to run Python and use the Jupyter notebook. Part 2 brings everyone up to the same level in Python - we introduce some useful libraries, how to use *functions* and common Python errors.

At the start of the Autumn Semester we will run a single session so you can get help with the material in these bootcamps before starting the PHY241 sessions.

## Bootcamp part I

In the folder pybootcamp-part1 are a collection of files that introduce what Python is, how to install it on your laptop, and how to run Python.

 - Open the notebook files and read them in order.

 - Complete any tasks that are indicated by green boxes in the notebook.

## Bootcamp part II

 - Open the notebook files and read them in order.

 - Complete any tasks that are indicated by green boxes in the notebook.

### Where do I get help?

Don't suffer in silence! If you get stuck or confused, try sending me an email at <s.littlefair@shef.ac.uk>.
You can get help directly from the notebook by opening the chat and typing a message that starts with `@Stuart Littlefair` -- this will email me and I'll get back to you as soon as possible.
