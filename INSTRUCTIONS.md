# Python Bootcamp Instructions

![SIR, YES SIR!](pybootcamp-part1/images/FMJ.jpg)

Welcome to Python bootcamp!

This course contains the Python Bootcamp for 2<sup>nd</sup> year astronomers. The idea behind the bootcamp is to prepare you for the Python programming part of PHY241. Programming is a vital skill for a scientist and you'll use it throughout your course, so it's important to get off to the right start.

## What should I do?

At the start of the Autumn Semester we will run two afternoon bootcamp sessions. These will cover the material in part II of the bootcamp. You **need** to have done some preparation work for those sessions over the summer break.

## Bootcamp part I

In the folder pybootcamp-part1 are a collection of files that introduce what Python is, how to install it on your laptop, and how to run Python. 

 - Open the notebook files and read them in order. 

 - Complete any tasks that are indicated by green boxes in the notebook.

Once you've completed those notebooks, go to [http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/Python_Bootcamp_1](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/Python_Bootcamp_1/index.html). Read the material and complete the exercises there, and you'll be in great shape to master Python when we start in the Autumn.

### Where do I get help?

It's always best to try and figure things out for yourself, but if you get stuck, send me an email at <s.littlefair@shef.ac.uk>.
