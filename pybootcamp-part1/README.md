Python Bootcamp - Part I
========================================================

Here are found IPython notebooks to assist with my 
Python Bootcamp for undergraduate astronomy students at the
University of Sheffield. 

Part I of this Bootcamp is to be done over the summer break, 
along with a few associated exercises.

Part II of the Bootcamp is run over two weeks at the start of term,
and will bring students up to speed with writing Python code.
