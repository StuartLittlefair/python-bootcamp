Astronomy Python Bootcamp at the University of Sheffield
========================================================

Here are found Jupyter notebooks for the Python bootcamp, which is run
each year for 2nd year  undergraduate astronomy students at the
University of Sheffield. 

These notebooks can be viewed statically online  [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/StuartLittlefair/python-bootcamp/tree/master/).

The notebooks are also available to run on Sage Math Cloud if you are enrolled on the Python Bootcamp Course.

Alternatively, if you would like to download and run the notebooks
interactively, you can do that. They are intended to be executed
with Jupyter 4 or newer. You can find installation instructions
[here](http://jupyter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html).

The notebooks and associated data can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/StuartLittlefair/python-bootcamp/zipball/master).
Unzip the notebooks:

```
unzip python-bootcamp.zip
```

and start the IPython notebook in the resulting directory.

```
jupyter notebook
```
