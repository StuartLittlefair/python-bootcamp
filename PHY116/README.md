PHY116
========================================================

IPython notebooks for the undergraduate astro lab on calculating
orbits, run in the spring semester at Sheffield University. 

These notebooks can be viewed statically online  [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/StuartLittlefair/python-teaching/tree/master/PHY116/).

Alternatively, if you would like to download and run the notebooks
interactively, you can do that. They are intended to be executed
with IPython 2.0 or newer. You can find installation instructions
[here](http://ipython.org/install.html).

The notebooks for all courses, and  the associated data can be downloaded 
[here](https://github.com/StuartLittlefair/python-teaching/zipball/master).
Unzip the notebooks:

```
unzip python-teaching.zip
```

and start the IPython notebook in the resulting directory.

```
ipython notebook
```
