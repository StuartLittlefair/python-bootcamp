Python Bootcamp - Part II
========================================================

Here are found IPython notebooks to assist with my 
Python Bootcamp for undergraduate astronomy students at the
University of Sheffield. 

Presently this bootcamp is given to students at the start of
their second year, but it is separated from MPS227 so that
it can be given to first year students, if necessary.

These notebooks can be viewed statically online  [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/StuartLittlefair/python-teaching/tree/master/).

Alternatively, if you would like to download and run the notebooks
interactively, you can do that. They are intended to be executed
with IPython 2.0 or newer. You can find installation instructions
[here](http://ipython.org/install.html).

The notebooks and associated data for all my Python courses can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/StuartLittlefair/python-teaching/zipball/master).
Unzip the notebooks

```
unzip python-teaching.zip
```

and start the IPython notebook in the resulting directory.

```
ipython notebook
```
